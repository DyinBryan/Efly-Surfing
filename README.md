Download Meteor Rejects
Install as you would with any other mod
https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-rejects/releases

Use Extra Efly;
Instant Fly=off
Speed Ctrl=on
Height Ctrl=off
Stop in water=on

Stay still when launching and hold forward while aiming up slightly, let go of forward and tap occasionally to prevent disconnecting.
It can be janky and drop you out of flight frequently but can still be used to cover large distances quickly if you get the hang of it
Mess around with other modules or settings and see if anything works better, Glide can help in my experience. Doesn't seem to work well vertically.
